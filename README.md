## Dataset
- Q1: 2.2  
- Q2: 8.6  
- Q3: 9.6  
- Q4: 10.43  
- **Average: 7.71**  

**Industry Target:** 15  

## Key Findings
- The company showed consistent growth quarter over quarter.  
- However, the current **average growth (7.71)** is **48.6% below** the industry target of 15.  
- While Q4 (10.43) shows improvement, it still falls short of the benchmark.  

## Business Implications
- Persisting below-target performance indicates limited competitiveness in the market.  
- This gap could reduce investor confidence and slow long-term revenue scaling.  
- Without strategic changes, reaching the benchmark may not be feasible in the short run.  

## Recommendations
To accelerate growth and close the gap with the industry target, the company should:  
1. **Expand into new market segments** to capture untapped customer bases.  
2. Diversify offerings to increase adoption.  
3. Enhance customer retention strategies to build on existing momentum.
